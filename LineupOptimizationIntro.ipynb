    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a basketball roster with 13 players who each have a constrained number of minutes they can play in a game and a plus/minus impact value for when they are in, assign the 200 playable minutes in a way that maximizes the total plus/minus for the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods for Optimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The methods for constrained optimization that I found are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Penalty Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method enforces the minutes restrictions by assigning a penalty for breaking them. This is not ideal for this problem because the constraints cannot be violated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Lagrange Multipliers\n",
    "\n",
    "This method solves the problem using a system of equations based on the conditions. This is impractical for this problem because there would be far too many equations to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Interior Point Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses barrier functions that will blow up to infinity when the constraints are hit. This is not good for this problem though because the constraint on total minutes played is an equality, not a \"barrier\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Augmented Lagrangian Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of the penalty method and lagrangian methods is not good either since the two methods it combines do not apply well to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Sequential Quadratic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate the problem at each iteration as a quadratic program (similar to Newton's Method). This method has no obvious downside for this problem so it is possible to look at an example:"
